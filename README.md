Simple translator from c/c++ to ruby


It's just 3 days job to try translate c code to ruby, because we have million of c code.

Theoretically, should use LL(1) parser, but this is a simple tool to help me to do something, completely machine translation is not necessary here.

I write this tool to help hopefully 90% parts of translation.

This simple tools definitely won't support template and and advanced feature of cpp11.
